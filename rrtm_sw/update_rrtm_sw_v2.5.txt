Date: April 2004

This is an update for users of RRTM_SW, the shortwave rapid 
radiative transfer model developed by Atmospheric and Environmental 
Research, Inc.  Users may obtain update information and retrieve code 
via the web-site http://rtweb.aer.com or via anonymous ftp to ftp.aer.com 
and change directory to pub/downloads/aer_rrtm_sw.  Binary data transfer 
should be used when downloading each file.

RRTM_SW v2.4.1 has been updated to RRTM_SW v2.5

		* Updated DISORT v1 to DISORT v2.

		* Improved cloud properties routine to:

		a) include scattering properties of spheres, based on the 
		parameterization by Key et al. in the STREAMER RT code.  
	
		b) to output a file (OUT_CLD_RRTM) with the cloud scattering 
		properties by layer. 

		c) changed name of cldprop_sw.f to cldprop.f to be 
		consistent with RRTM_LW structure.

		* Updated atmospheric properties module RRTATM to be 
		compatible with the most recent version of LBLATM v8.1.
	
	 	* Removed unnecessary duplicate calculations which 
		occurred for option IOUT=98.

		* Added new solar variability option (ISOLVAR).

	 	* Changed number of significant digits in the net flux 
		output in OUTPUT_RRTM.  
	
		* Changed format statement in subroutine readaer to allow
	        more than 4 aerosol layers (naer, format statement 9010).

        	* Updated instruction manual.

		* Modified makefiles to be double precision, as required 
		to keep robust results from DISORT.

                          *** KEY FEATURES ***
                           *** IN RRTM_SW ***

^ k-distributions are obtained directly from a line-by-line radiative
transfer code, LBLRTM , which has been extensively validated against 
observations, principally at the ARM SGP site 

^ fluxes and cooling  rates can be calculated over fourteen 
contiguous bands in the  shortwave (820-50000 cm-1) 

^ modeled sources of extinction are water vapor, carbon dioxide, 
ozone, methane, oxygen, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering, and clouds 

     ^ liquid cloud optical properties are parameterized using the Hu 
       and Stamnes parameterization (J. Climate, 6, 728-742, 1993) 
     ^ ice cloud optical properties are parameterized using the 
       Fu parameterization (J. Climate, 9, 2058 - 2082, 1996) 

^ DISORT is used to perform scattering calculations 
(Stamnes et al., Appl. Opt. 27, 2502-2509, 1988) 

^ agreement with clear-sky line-by-line calculations: 
1 W/m2 for direct irradiance, 2 W/m2 for diffuse irradiance 

^ Important note:  Version 2.4 of RRTM_SW handles only 
100% cloudy cases.  Partial cloudiness is not an option at this time.
